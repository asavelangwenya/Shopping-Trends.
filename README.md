# üöò PROJECT OVERVIEW

The objective of this project is to design an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that delivers rich insights into:

**Customer Segmentation** ‚Äì understanding different customer groups and their behaviors.

**Product Performance** ‚Äì analyzing product trends, top performers, and underperformers.

**Revenue Analysis** ‚Äì tracking revenue drivers, growth trends, and areas of improvement.

This dashboard is built to support data-driven decision-making by presenting complex information in a clear and accessible way.
One example involves calculating month-over-month growth in service appointments, where I used a CTE combined with the LAG() function to compare monthly totals ‚Äî a useful technique in trend analysis and reporting.
